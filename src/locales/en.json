The Kanien’kehá:ka are one of the five founding nations of the Haudenosaunee confederacy and are known as the “Keepers of the Eastern Door.” The island we call Montréal is known as Tiotia:ke in the Kanien’kehá:ka language, and has historically served as a meeting place for other Indigenous nations. In our studies in the World Islamic and Middle East Studies Department, we pursue understanding and solidarity with people in the “Middle East” and throughout the Islamicate world. We likewise affirm our desire for solidarity with indigenous communities here in Tiotia:ke and across Turtle Island (North America) by promoting an inclusive academic space for indigenous histories and narratives to be heard alongside those in our own field of study."
